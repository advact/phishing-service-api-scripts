# What is in this Repository?
This repository is specifically tailored for our customers and is structured to enhance your experience with our phishing services. It contains a carefully curated collection of scripts that you can utilize independently.

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each dedicated to different aspects. These subdirectories include scripts for automating routine tasks, retrieving data and more, making it easier to find the tools you need.

# Script Descriptions

##  [Get-bad-behaviour](Get-bad-behaviour/README.md)
This script is used to notify supervisors when their subordinate triggered bad behaviour in our Phishing-Simulation Service. It scans for bad behaviour of the last day, and sends an e-mail to each supervisor with the report.

##  [service-statistic-visualized](service-statistic-visualized/README.md)
This script retrieves all statistics data from each custom field for a selected service and visualizes them in bar chars. This allows you to determine which custom field performs the best, among other insights.
